# Encrypted-Messaging-System
It is a project made for users to send encrypted messages to each other over a local connection.
The user can send his message to another user using the encryption algorithm he wants;
If the Spn-16 algorithm is selected, the user encrypts the message with the private key and sends the message. The user receiving the message can decrypt the message with the key used in encryption.
If the Sha-256 algorithm is selected, the message is encrypted in a way that can't be decrypted.
